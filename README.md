# Action Order

A competitive 1v1 tactical card combat game built for **Celo MiniPay**. Players construct a 5-move sequence called an Order and watch it resolve against their opponent's in cinematic combat — no turns, no clicking during the fight. Pure prediction.

---

## Gameplay

1. **Pick a character** — each fighter has unique stats that affect knock calculations
2. **Build your Order** — arrange 5 cards (Strike / Defense / Control) in a 5-slot sequence
3. **Lock in** — both players submit simultaneously; neither can see the other's order
4. **Watch it resolve** — slots play out one-by-one; knock values determine the round winner
5. **Best of rounds wins the match**

Cards interact on three axes: priority, knock value, and type advantage. Winning requires reading your opponent, not just picking the strongest cards.

- `completeMatch(matchId, winner)` — called server-side; pays out winner
- Entry fee: **0.000007 CELO/cUSD** (optimised for activity volume)
- Events: `MatchEntered`, `MatchCompleted`, `MatchRefunded`

Deploy / verify:

npx hardhat verify --network celo <address>
```

## Multiplayer

Matches are coordinated through stateless API routes:

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/match/[matchId]` | Register character selection |
| `PATCH /api/match/[matchId]` | Submit card order for a round |
| `GET /api/match/[matchId]` | Poll match phase / resolved slots |
| `DELETE /api/match/[matchId]` | Clean up finished match |

Both players lock their order independently. The server resolves the round and returns results from each player's perspective when both orders are in. Match state lives in memory — a server restart clears active matches.
